# Arpege

Arpege is a music library manager that offers modern streaming capabilities like, well, streaming, sharing links and downloading to client devices.
Bring your own [legally obtained] music. Own your music and stream it!

** motivation **

Arpege exists because as much as I hate iTunes all my music is in there. I can't find any good tool to migrate my iTune library playlists, songs etc. I also like to own my music and it's the only way I can push songs to my iPhone besides being songs. There are currently no other solutions that offers a modern music streaming app, based on an existing library on a filesystem.
